=======
What servers would you need if...
    80% of your content is read only
    All data is stored in a database
    Frontend is a SinglePage App
    Each backend server can handle 200 requests at a time
    Peak load is estimated to be 500 requests at a time

Solution
========
Cache
Frontend server
3 backend servers
Database server
